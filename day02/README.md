LAB INSTRUCTIONS:

Connect the network devices together according to the labels.

Use the appropriate type of cable .

For practice, assume that Auto MDI-X is disabled, or not supported on the devices.

NOTE: Packet Tracer doesn't differentiate between single-mode 
and multimode fiber, but think about which one is appropriate when you 
use a fiber connection.
